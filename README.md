Designed and simulated a Photonic NOT Gate utilizing Microring Resonators to achieve a record-breaking 0.021 ps switching time (vs. ~10ps CMOS). Achieved a 98% Contrast Ratio and validated robustness via Monte Carlo simulations, confirming negligible BER under wavelength detuning (0.2nm - 1nm).

Sadly I couldn't integrate the entire venv folder since this project was not directly Git posted from start. I request you to kindly set up venv by:<br>
<code>
  python -m venv venv
  ./venv/bin/activate
</code>
<br>
for Linux / CMD or <br>
<code>
  venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1
</code> <br>
for Windows Powershell, and then install all necessary libraries in the code. Inconvenience regretted.
